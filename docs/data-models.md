# Hooligan Hymnal Data Models Guide

This document presents an overview of the data models used by the Hooligan Hymnal platform, and is intended to help admin users populate the Hooligan Hymnal database with confidence. The data models are introduced in the order we think you should become familiar with them.

Please review the project README for a description of the platform and the philosophy behind it.
