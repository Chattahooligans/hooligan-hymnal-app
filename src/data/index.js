    "Pardon me, boy\nIs that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?\nTrack twenty-nine\nCan you give me a shine?\nI can afford to board the\nChattanooga Choo Choo?\nI've got my fare\nAnd just a trifle to spare.\n\nWhen you hear the whistle\nBlowin' eight to the bar!\nThen you know that\nTennessee is not very far!\nShovel all the coal in\nGotta keep it rollin'\nWoo, woo, Chattanooga\nThere you are!
