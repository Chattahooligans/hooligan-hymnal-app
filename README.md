# Hooligan Hymnal

[egotistical introduction of the project]
From the minds that brought you supporter culture revalations like Prideraiser.org and positioning capos in the back of the section, The Chattahooligans, independent supporters of Chattanooga Football Club, have conceived the future of SG information flow- Hooligan Hymnal. After rigorous experimentation and seeing our community embrace the technology, we shared it with our Mitten-state frenemies, the Northern Guard Supporters, and are advancing the platform even further.

At long last, we're sharing this revolutionary invention with the world- to improve supporter culture for all of us and to make managing supporters groups less exhausting.

## Features

[brief table-setting]
The smartphone application and server are chock full of useful features, each born from necessity and based on the experience of managing one of the most sophisticated supporters groups in the game.

### Digital Songbook/Chant Sheet

Always up-to-date, no printing or folding required.

The Hooligan Hymnal songbook can include links to YouTube/Soundcloud, sheet music for brass players, and has an interactive Table of Contents. SGs with large libraries of stadium chants and songs can stay organized by sorting them into chapters.

### Supporter-managed Roster

Opening the app is faster for your fans than having them navigate through a club or league website.

Put some swagger into your deployment with custom bios and photo albums. Include links to players' Instagram and Twitter accounts so fans can give them well wishes on match day.

_Friends and Foes_ will include opponent's roster information right in the app, thanks to a growing collection of league website scrapers.

### Updates and Push Notifications

Send a reference to tricky song lyrics to every phone in the section, right before your capos call for it, to learn new material easier. Issue announcements about special events, merch drops, and more. Updates and push notifications get the information you want circulated in front of the eyeballs of your fans, without relying on the mercy of social media algorithms.

### And More

## Roadmap

[CALL TO ACTION to get more developers]
Necessity is the mother of invention. By sharing the project with soccer supporters groups around the world, we will assemble the greatest minds in the culture as contributors, and our collective work will improve all of our communities. 

### News Feed

The updates/push notifications feature was originally added to circulate chants in the stadium, then we realized later it could also be used for special announcements. Our next major feature will be an in-app news feed, a polished experience to keep our fans informed, all without having to pay Facebook to let them see what we post.

### Localization

We committed to outreach to non-English-speaking communities to bring new fans to the clubs we love. Hooligan Hymnal will have a foundation for localization out-of-the box, so non-native speakers can navigate the application interface, and allowing _La Barra_ supporters to publish their own apps as easily as English-speaking SGs. 

### Web-based Data Management

Editing raw JSON is getting old, and we need a better way to keep Capo/SG officer features secure. A web-based application to manage all of the Hooligan Hymnal data is coming soon.

### And Beyond

[TBD what we want to include in this section]

## For Developers

Hooligan Hymnal is a React Native project for Android and iOS devices built using [Expo](https://expo.io) with a Node.js backend and web-based administration tools built with Vue.js

Review the `docs` directory for information on how to configure and customize the app, and to prepare to deploy to Google Play and the App Store. Visit the [hymnal-server](https://github.com/Chattahooligans/hymnal-server) repo for the server, which is required to serve data to the client.

Hooligan Hymnal maintains an active Slack channel with developers and SG leadership to guide the future of the platform. Our DMs are open [@hooliganhymnal](https://twitter.com/hooliganhymnal), if you can contribute to the project.
